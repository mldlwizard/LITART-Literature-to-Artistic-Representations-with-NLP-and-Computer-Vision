    3. Run `pipeline.py` with the appropriate paths set.
    4. Check results in "results" dir.
3. If you want to experiment with existing books
    1. Run `pipeline.py` and sit back.
    2. Check results in "results" dir.

NOTE: This experiment will take a while to be sure to grab popcorn and your fav soda ;).
